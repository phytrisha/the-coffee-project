# Default ignore patterns for Xcode projects

# Built Products
build/
DerivedData/

# Logs and temporary files
*.log
*.tmp

# User-specific files
*.xcuserdatad/
*.xcuserstate

# Xcode Cache Files
# These might be found inside .xcodeproj or .xcworkspace bundles
*.xcworkspace/xcuserdata/
*.xcodeproj/xcuserdata/

# Interface Builder SIB files (often generated)
*.sib

# Swift Package Manager dependencies
# If you use SwiftPM, this folder can be large and should be ignored
.build/

# CocoaPods dependencies
# If you use CocoaPods, the Pods directory should be ignored
Pods/

# Carthage dependencies
# If you use Carthage, the Build directory should be ignored
Carthage/Build/

# Playgrounds
# Sometimes you might want to ignore entire playgrounds if they are just scratchpads
# *.playground/

# macOS system files (often created by Finder)
.DS_Store

# Crash reports
*.crash

# Profiling data

# --- Handling .plist files ---
# WARNING: Generally, you DO NOT want to ignore essential files like Info.plist.
# The pattern below ignores *all* .plist files by default,
# BUT then negates (does NOT ignore) any file specifically named Info.plist.
# This is a common pattern if you have other temporary or generated .plist files
# you want to exclude, but want to keep the crucial Info.plist files.

# Ignore all .plist files
*.plist

# BUT, do NOT ignore the essential Info.plist files
!*/Info.plist

# If you only have Info.plist and no other .plist files to ignore,
# you can remove the two lines above and ignore specific non-essential
# .plist files individually if they arise.

# Ignore all Font files
